# aamva_parser

Scans an AAMVA drivers license

Copying the implementation from this python library: https://github.com/rechner/py-aamva

Note that this is only partially completed for _some_ versions of AAMVA barcodes and this has only been tested for _some_ provinces and states.

## Warning
This code was hacked together in a day and isn't great, use at your own peril
